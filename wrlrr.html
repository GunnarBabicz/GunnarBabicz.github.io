            <p> Wind Riders of the Lost River Range was a group project lasting from August 2022 to
                December 2022. Our team was given a memo detailing a fictional business and their needs
                for a new, updated database. Our team planned and designed the database from scratch,
                including entity relations, queries, and stored procedures. <br> <br> This project is
                still assigned to students at Idaho State University, so any finished code is unable
                to be shared. The original memo was published by Communications of the Association for 
                 Information Systems in 2005 and is viewable by the public.</p>
